# eQTL-Catalogue/qcnorm workflow

**This pipeline will run QC measures of both genotype and phenotype data and will normalise quantified phenotypes**.

## Introduction

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install one of [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) or [`conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command


> Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile institute` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

iv. Start running your own analysis!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Update the default command above used to run the pipeline -->


See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

## Documentation

The eQTL-Catalogue/qcnorm pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline, found in the `docs/` directory:
